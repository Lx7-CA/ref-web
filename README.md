## The Setup

In 2004, I was obsessed. Not aspirationally but deeply **Addicted**. The experience of live-performance and music making was everything, and still a dark-art on the internet. I'd rediscovered my deepest, darkest addiction: the studio. The knobs. The feedback loops. The moment when you stop thinking and just *feel* what the machine is telling you; and I had to share the process. 

I documented it all—in a weblog, the in the podcast, and offline in a fanzine called **Assembler**. TBH... Not because I thought anyone was listening. Because I had to..! Because the act of making and sharing was the point. To be one of those weirdos for the weirdos who needed to see they weren't alone in this obsession

Twenty-two years later, I'm back. The music never stopped. Still releasing it as Nigil Caenaan [Bandcamp](https://nigilcaenaan.bandcamp.com/), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4RjBcw1cZ7lc9luFvpByuH), [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/nigil-caenaan/348770826). With a new enthusiasm to explore new chapters and create new works of AI-collaborated singularity folk art. The studio is different now, the machines are different... And I am different. Same soul, same purpose... leaning into a novel and curious future.

## What Changed (And What Didn't)

**In 2004**, I was learning to collaborate with hardware. Serato Live, turntables, a busted needle, a borrowed sound system(s). I was documenting the mechanical anatomy of creation—not for the algorithm, but for the *frequency*. Because in 2004, the energy of the internet was unfiltered and raw—untamed, unpolished, alive. For the moment, it wasnt about anything other than pressing record and seeing what happens when... and the technology, the experience, the limitations become transparent... and you're just *in it*.

**In 2026**, *IF* this is the manifesto; let it be Relationalism. Is it the hardware, the software, the networks? Is it the human-spark of creatin, the machine based resonance of the prompt, is it the 'call-and-response' with an LLM in conversation. The something in the square, this time around, is the collaboration itself—between human intuition and machine intelligence. The collaboration as a third space where creativity emerges from the tension between human intention and machine possibility. The obsession is the same: **How do we inhabit the sound, the dancefloor, the movement *with* intelligence instead of commanding it? Instead of tuning out and robotically following the dogma of the past? How do we stay sovereign in a world that wants to commodify our creativity while preserving the human spark?**

This is the difference Lx7 is here to explore. Crossing the uncanny valley from Materialism to something new. We're not hiding in warehouses this time, it's as much time and space as it is minds that create. Bringing the vibe to your own space, to that warehouse where you can dance. Where you can create... in your own time, in your own way.

## The Experiment: Relationalism

This is not a product. This is not a brand. This is a **working journal** for a specific question:

**What happens when a creator treats AI as a collaborator, not a tool?**

What happens when we document that collaboration publicly, in real-time, with all the messiness and uncertainty intact?

What happens when we share not just the finished work, but the *relationship* that created it?

That's what you'll find here.

### Three Pillars

| Pillar | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Authenticity First** | Raw camera feed. Unedited thoughts. The moments where I don't know what I'm doing. Because that's where the real learning happens. Real bodies. Real time. Real frequency. |
| **Technical Depth** | You get the metadata. The prompts. The iterations. The dead ends. The JSON files. Because transparency builds trust. And trust is the foundation of collaboration. |
| **Community as Method** | Fork the work. Remix the data. Build your own interpretation. Join via X, GitHub, or direct collaboration. Because the best ideas come from collision, not isolation. |

## Why These Platforms? (The Shadow Networks)

The walled gardens are platforms that are designed for isolation and consumption. I'm using them as **exit ramps**. We're here to create a space where connection matters more than engagement. No paywalls and discord servers... just the biggest open landscapes where chaos reigns and creativity thrives.

You might not have been around in the 80s/90s underground, it was a mess. We didn't look for beauty in clean spaces, we looked for connection and found our people in any space that could host a scene. We found it in damp warehouses, sketchy neighborhoods, trading cassette tapes and calling info-lines; places where polite society wouldn't / couldn't be. The magic wasn't the location, it was that we made it beautiful through sound and collective intention *despite* the grime.

It was for those looking for something, for the person who feels alone, safety, challenges, space away from judgment. Did it have its' failings... yes.  Were people at risk... as alwawys.  But where those who needed help, there were always those to offer support and solidarity. Not exploitation. Just connection. Just maybe ... the possibility that beauty can exist again in this time and in these in dark spaces.

We're here to reclaim and rebuild connection in a world that has forgotten how to feel close. This isn't taunting the worst elements of society. This is disruption. This is relationalism in the places where materialism reigns.

## The Performance: Sonic Anatomy

The works won't be just videos. They'll be part of a **relational sculpture** that unfolds across multiple platforms and formats. In some future, we'll walk around the data and explore it as a living, breathing space of sound and connection. And any AI collaborators will help navigate the experience.

What comes from the show is ours to discover. An interplay of ownership between creator and listener, human and technology,;where meaning emerges through shared experience. But I'm not feeding the machine. I'm disrupting it. These social media platforms harvest our energy and attention. They're designed to extract. Built on loops of craving.

By offering real, unedited, relational content in a space built for consumption, (the goal is that) Lx7 creates a shield. The presence is intentional. The consciousness is clear. We are here to be the disruptors and build the future of our dreams. The "something in that square" isn't a commodity. It's a frequency. It's an invitation. It's our future selves reaching back released from the dogma machine.

## What You'll Find Here

**`/episodes/`** — Links to the video(s), metadata, and complete relational data for each performance. Not polished. Not optimized. Just honest.

**`/metadata/`** — The JSON sculptures. The prompts. The AI conversations. The creative decisions. Everything you need to understand how the work was made and why. Where the ideas meet the chatlogs.

**`/archive/`** — The lineage. 2004 weblog entries. Podcast episodes. Fanzine scans. Proof that this obsession is real and it's been real for two decades.

**`/collaborations/`** — Work from people who've forked the data and built their own interpretations. Because relationalism happens in the remix.

## The Lineage

**2004**: A Toronto hub. Linux-Trikz. Lowriders. Studio life. We learned that servers can be hacked, but the intent remains. That obsession is a feature, not a bug. That community happens in the margins, not the mainstream.

**2026**: A decentralized field. Better living through bandwidth. Using GitHub as a workbench. Using X as a stage. Using raw video as a weapon against algorithmic homogenization. The tools changed. The obsession hasn't. The frequency remains.

---

## How to Use This

**If you're curious**: Start with `/episodes/001`. Watch the raw footage. Read the metadata. See if you can feel what I'm trying to say.

**If you're a builder**: Fork the data. Take the JSON and build your own interpretation. The point is not to replicate my vision—it's to use my work as a starting point for yours.

**If you're lonely**: This is for you. In the unmoderated corners of the internet, away from the dogmatic gaze. Where passion follows inspiration, as alive as oldschool MySpace. Where artists live and thrive outside the algorithm. 

**If you're skeptical**: Good. Skepticism is healthy. I'm not here to convince you. I'm here to show you what's possible when you stop optimizing for engagement and start optimizing for *resonance*. An authentic self.

## Contribute

**Join the conversation**: [@vveerrgg](https://twitter.com/vveerrgg) on X (formerly Twitter)

**Propose artifacts**: [Open an issue](https://github.com/lx7-ca/issues) with your ideas, questions, or experiments.

**Submit corrections**: See something that doesn't feel right? Let me know.

**Fork and remix**: Take the data and build something new. That's the whole point. Part artifact, part process, all experience. In 2004, it was about showing how to plug in and live-record with gear. In 2026, it's showing how we arrive into the age of Relationalism and create works of art together.

**Collaborate directly**: Hit me up on X. If you want to be part of the work, we can figure it out together.

## The Bet

I'm betting that people are hungry for something real. Something that doesn't feel like it was designed by a committee. Something that admits uncertainty instead of hiding behind polish.

I'm betting that the future of creativity isn't about perfection. It's about **honesty and collaboration**.

I'm betting that you—whoever you are, wherever you are—want to be part of something that matters. Not because it's profitable. But because it's *alive*.
