# Site Strategy: Re-Discovery of the Relational Web

---

## The Core Philosophy

The README tells you *why* this exists and, the bet on relationalism. This document tells you *how* it works—the structure, the protocols, the invitation to fork and build. This isn't a content strategy. It's an **architecture for connection**.

## 1. The Ethos: Sovereignty & Resonance

**This is not a site nor is it a platform; it is part of a field.**

In the early days of the web, personal sites were digital homes built with intentionality—specific, often idiosyncratic logic. Not "profiles" optimized for an algorithm, but spaces that reflected the creator's creative whimsy. Anyone who's had a MySpace page probably remembers the joy of customizing every pixel.

Lx7.ca is an homage to that era of **Sovereign Creativity**. Reclaiming the "Unexpected Internet". Where passion follows inspiration rather than engagement metrics. Where the work lives permanently in a place you control, not rented from a platform that can change the rules overnight. 

### The Shift We're Making

**From Materialism to Relationalism**: Moving from "content consumption" to "performance artifacts". It's measured by resonance and what people build with it. So take it, fork it, remix it, and build your own version.

**The Third Space**: AI as collaborator, not tool. Creating a "Sonic Anatomy" where meaning emerges from the tension between human intuition and machine possibility. Not human *or* machine, but the space *between* them.

The core question, *"What happens when a creator treats AI as a collaborator, not a tool?"*

## 2. The Architecture of Openness

The folder structure is designed to be **Modular and Forkable**. The future of the social web is decentralized and peer-to-peer. This repo is built for that future.

### JSON-First Discovery

By using structured data (`toc.json`, `web-ring.json`, `footer.json`), we make our identity and rituals "widgetizable"—shareable across the web without needing a central authority.

The data *is* the artifact. The structure *is* the invitation. When done well, an LLM can navigate the site (or repo) and have a shared understanding of the page, the content and the creativity within.

## 3. The "Borrow & Build" Protocol

This repository is a **blueprint**. Treat it as an open-source "MySpace" starter kit for a relational web. 

**Fork the Repo(sitory)**: Take the `README.md` and `TECH-SETUP.md` as templates for your own mission. Change the names, swap the links, make it yours.

**Remix the Rituals**: Use the `/metadata/` and `/episodes/` schemas to document your own creative acts. The JSON structure is portable—build your own tools around it. And if you're not sure how to use it, just ask an LLM to help you.

**Link the Ring**: Use the `web-ring.json` to create your own "Top 5" trusted nodes. Rebuild the web one intentional connection at a time.

The point isn't to replicate this vision; it's to use this and build on it, as a starting point for yours. We don't optimize for "likes" or "shares." We optimize for **Resonance**.

**Success is a Fork**: Someone taking this site (and ideas) and building their own interpretation. That's the proof that the structure works beyond the square.

**Success is a Connection**: Shine a light in your dark corner! A lonely person in a dark space finding a frequency and connections that feels like home, that's what this is about. A lighthouse for ideas and like minded ppl to vibe with.

**Success is the Deadline**: Moving from the "I have an idea" to the "I put it out there just to see what happens" as an artifact. Shipping the work, mistakes and all. Making it real. Its that difference that is each breath as an idea. 

**Success is Transparency**: Showing the process, not just the product. The prompts. The iterations. The dead ends. Because that's where the real learning happens. We don't have the words, the processes and the shared langage... not yet... but here we are, building it together.

## 4. The Technical Implementation

### Why This Structure?

**GitHub as Workbench**: Not just a code repository—a place where the creative process is visible, forkable, and remixable. Version control becomes storytelling.

**JSON as Lingua Franca**: Portable, readable, platform-agnostic. Anyone can parse it, display it their own way, build tools around it, integrate it into their projects—no permission needed.

**Media as the artifact**: Against algorithmic homogenization. "do what you do, and be what you be." As unedited, unpolished, and unapologetically human. Find that authentic language as the antidote to the "content creator" aesthetic. Proof the work is real. From a place where you are going as deep down that rabbit hole as you need to find the flow that is uniquely yours.

## 5. The Shadow Networks Strategy

We're not building *on* these platforms. We're *using* them.

| Platform | Purpose | Strategy |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **X (Twitter)** | Real-time conversation & discovery | Share raw thoughts, link to the data field, find collaborators |
| **YouTube** | Video archive & reach | Host the raw footage, use as an exit ramp back to the repo |
| **GitHub** | The hardened sanctuary | The source of truth. Where the work lives permanently |
| **Bandcamp** | Music distribution & support | Where the finished artifacts live and can be supported directly |

The platforms are the **exit ramps**. The repository is the **destination**.

## 6. The Relational Contract

If you're here, you're part of this. Not as a consumer, but as a **participant**. With...

- **Transparency**: The metadata. The prompts. The iterations. The dead ends.
- **Authenticity**: Raw camera feed. Unedited thoughts. The moments where we don't know what we're doing.
- **Openness**: Fork the work. Remix the data. Build your own interpretation.

### What We Ask

- **Curiosity**: Approach the work with an open mind.
- **Contribution**: If you build something, share it back.
- **Connection**: If you feel the frequency, let us know. That's the whole point.

## The Long Game

This is not a sprint. This is a **practice**.

The goal isn't to "go viral" or "build an audience." The goal is to create a body of work that matters. That when the purpose is joy. When your future self looks back ... the works you create are reminders of what you're meant to do, and why your voice matters to you, and to all of us here with you. Document that relationship, create new ones between human, machine, and everyone who sees you shine.

Be that sense of self, your creativity in the age of AI, one that doesn't have to be about automation or efficiency; but is all about singing from your soul.

## Key Principles

1. **Data is the artifact** — The JSON files are as important as the videos
2. **Process is the product** — Show the work, not just the result
3. **Forkability is a feature** — Make it easy for others to build on this
4. **Resonance over reach** — Quality of connection matters more than quantity
5. **Sovereignty over convenience** — Own the data, control the narrative
